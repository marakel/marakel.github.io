I am a recent graduate from Binghamton University seeking an entry level position. I studied mathematics with a specific focus on statistics, data analysis, and machine learning. I have some experience with data analysis in python and excel, writing queries in SQL, and statistical analysis in R.
I have included some basic projects on this page and will continually update it with more in the future.
